# HMMTutorial
An R tutorial on how to use HHMs to find recombination events in GBS data
from a biparental cross.

Files are in R markdown format .Rmd

can be rendered with the push of a buttom from RStudio,

of from any R installation by using the following commands

install.packages("rmarkdown")

setwd("~/your local directory/")

rmarkdown::render("1_BiparentalSim.Rmd")

Files 5_Simulations.Rmd and 6_MoreSimulations.Rmd make thousands of simulations and take about 10 min to render.
